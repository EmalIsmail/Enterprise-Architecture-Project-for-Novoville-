# Enterprise Architecture Project for Novoville - Koblenz University
 This project suggest improvements to the existing enterprise architecture of civil engagement platform Novoville. The below content provides a brife description of project content arrangment.

# PP – Preliminary Phase:
1. The scope of your Enterprise (Baseline Architecture) for the EA work using a rich picture (use MS Visio) and textual descriptions. The scope description contain the main aspects.
2. Business model canvas detailing the important aspects for the enterprise scope you are focusing on (the Template from the Exercise or Archi’s Business Model Canvas Template)
3. Four architecture principles on different levels (business, data, application, technology) for your scenario using the tabular template introduced in the lecture
AVP – Architecture Vision Phase 
4. Key internal and external stakeholders (at least 3) and elaborate the respective entries in the adjusted Stakeholder involvement map as presented in the lecture
5. Description of one internal and one external business driver that drive the architecture work.
6. Explicitly show and explain the planned changes in the enterprise by developing the architecture vision of your Enterprise using a rich picture (use MS Visio) and textual descriptions for the main aspects for your target architecture.
   
# BAP – Business Architecture:
8. Relevant Viewpoints (at least 2) according to the stakeholder concerns (spotted in the stakeholder matrix of task 4 above) that you will consider in developing the target Business Architecture (cf. subsequent task). Thereby clearly spot the views governed by the viewpoints. 
9. Relevant use-case diagrams or a process landscape AND process models showing the relevant baseline and target business processes of your scenario using UML (or process landscape) and BPMN, Event-driven Process Chain, Adonis Flow diagrams, or ArchiMate diagrams (depending on the model kinds and tool(s) you choose). Make sure that you first provide an overview and then present the relevant processes that address the stakeholder concerns of task 7 in more detail. 
10. Two functional business requirements and enter them in the requirements table of task 22 on Requirements Management.
11. Gap Analysis by identifying specific changes (at least two) needed to achieve the target Business Architecture (based on a comparison of the baseline and target architectures)
12. To address the previously identified gaps, identify at least two major roadmap component(s) for the target business architecture and briefly describe what these components deliver and to whom. 

# ISAP – Information Systems Architecture Phase (19p):
13. Architecture development approach of the ISAP? Argue of the best approach (Application or Data) to your specific project and provide a reasonable argumentation. 
Depending on your answer here develop either task 13 or 14 first.
14. Baseline and target data architecture for your scenario, highlighting the changes in the target data architecture:
a. Outline of the Viewpoints (at least 2) according to the stakeholder concerns (spotted in the stakeholder matrix of task 4 above) that you will consider in developing the target Data Architecture (cf. subsequent task). Thereby clearly spot the views governed by the viewpoints 
b. Baseline and target Data Architecture using a UML class diagram for your major data aspects. The diagram can be one but the target elements must be clearly highlighted. Focus on the main data elements that you need in your project 
c. Gap analysis and identify the major changes in the Data Architecture (at least two)
d. Major roadmap component(s) (at least two) for the data architecture and briefly describe the functionalities and features of these components
e. Two functional requirements regarding the data and enter them in the requirements table in the task 22 of Requirements Management

16. Application architecture for your scenario that addresses the baseline as well as the target architecture, highlighting the changes:
f. The Viewpoints according to the stakeholder concerns (spotted in the stakeholder matrix of task 4 above) that you will consider in developing the target Application Architecture (cf. subsequent task). Thereby clearly spot the views governed by the viewpoints
g. Baseline and target Application Architecture for your project using the IT Systems model or Archi®, considering the information system services and logical application components. Clearly highlight new elements related to the target architecture.
h. Gap analysis and identification the major changes in the Application Architecture
i. The major roadmap components for the application architecture (at least two) and briefly describe the functionalities / features of these components
j. Specify at least two functional requirements concerning the application(s) and enter them in the requirements table in the task 22 of Requirements Management (below) 

# TAP – Technology Architecture Phase:
17. Develop a baseline and target Technology Architecture model using IT-Systems model or Archi® (can be one model highlighting the changes) therewith detailing the technology component(s) realising the applications defined in the Application Architecture (i.e. by expanding the IT-Systems model of the Application Architecture). Make sure that the changes for the target architecture are properly highlighted and that the connections between the technology components and elements of the application architecture are clearly identifiable! Also, for each component listed, indicate whether it is a logical or physical component.
18. Perform a gap analysis and identify the major changes in the Technology Architecture (at least two) 
19. Identify the major roadmap component(s) (at least two) for the technology architecture and briefly describe the functionalities / features of these components 
20. Specify at least two functional requirements regarding the technological views and enter them in the requirements table in the task 22 of Requirements Management (below) 

# OSP – Opportunities and Solutions Phase:
21. Create a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions and Dependencies Matrix (using the TOGAF template), containing the gaps you have identified in the previous phases.
22. Define and describe reasonable content-wise work packages for the implementation of the target architecture you developed (project management and dissemination will not result in points for the task) – use a tabular representation. Indicate also the start month and end month per work package, and any dependencies among these work packages, if such exist.
Note: table should contain the following columns: Nr. WP | Name of WP | Brief Description of WP | Start month | End month | Dependency to WP Nr. and description
23. Please name and explain which overall Implementation and Migration Strategy you will follow for the implementation of your target architecture and why.
    
# RequM – Requirements Management Phase:
24. Build up the list of functional requirements by filling in the requirements table (provided in OLAT along the exercise, including prioritisation). The functional requirements should naturally emerge from the target architecture elements defined before (points are given along the Architecture work tasks above).
25. Specify six non-functional requirements in at least two different categories by filling in the respective requirements table for non-functional requirements (including prioritisation). These must have a clear reference to the functional requirements or the realisation of the target architecture goals. 
26. Define measurement indicators for each of the functional and non-functional requirements (enter them in the requirements table). 

# RiskM – Risk Management:
27. Perform Risk Assessment by defining four risks for your EA work (three of these risks should be related to the EA work and one should be related to the work packages you defined in task 20 of the OSP above) and filling in the risk management table provided in OLAT along the lecture 11 (slides 45-46), including the assessment of the severity of impact and the probability/likelihood that the risk occurs. Additionally, define risk mitigation measures to prevent the occurrence of the risks and place the risks in a 3x3 risk assessment matrix (cf. slides 48-49 of lecture 11). 
Architecture repository and Architecture Content Framework (5p):
28. Provide an inventory (a list) of all artefacts you have developed as part of your EA work for the EA repository. Briefly describe each of the artefacts and their status and sort them along the TOGAF ADM phases. 
29. Define the contractual deliverables that result from the main work packages (s. task 20) and indicate, which of the artefacts of the previous task belong to which deliverable. 
Note: use a table that should contain the following columns: Del. Nr. | Name and brief description of Deliverable | WP | Artefacts part of the deliverable | Due date |Means of verification


Reference list:
33. Provide a structured list of all sources (e.g. documentation, papers, URLs).
